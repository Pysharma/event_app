Event App

This GitHub repository contains an Event App project. The project structure includes three screens located in the "screens" directory. The Dart files for these screens are named "HomeScreen", "EventScreen", and "SearchScreen". Additionally, there is a "widget" directory that contains a custom app bar specifically designed for the EventScreen.

Here are some key features of each screen:

Home Screen: This screen displays a list of items in a card format. Each item has an "onTap" functionality, allowing users to interact with it. The screen also includes a search option for filtering events.

Search Screen: On this screen, a circular progress indicator with a duration of 1 second is implemented, as specified in the assignment requirements. There is a text field where users can enter their search query, and only the events matching the search criteria will be displayed.

Event Screen: This screen is designed according to the provided Figma design and the data is been fetched from the api that has been provided.
